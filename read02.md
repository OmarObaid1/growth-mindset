## what is the GitHub?
As previously mentioned, GitHub is a hub-focused tool which facilitates Integration-Manager Workflow. It is the largest existing host for Git repositories and is used by millions of developers worldwide. A high percentage of Git repositories reside on GitHub, and this resource is used by many open source projects

 ## Contributing to Projects
To contribute to a project which you do not have push privileges for, you can “fork” a project, which means you will have your own copy of it, which you can freely push to. To complete a “fork,” look for the Fork button at the top right of the project page

## General Workflow

GitHub’s collaboration workflow revolves around Pull Requests.

Here are the main steps of the GitHub collaboration workflow:

+ Create a topic branch from master.
+ Commit changes for the project.
+ Push the topic branch to the GitHub project.
+ Open a Pull Request.
+ Confer with team and perform additional commits, if applicable.
+ The project owner closes or merges the Pull Request.
