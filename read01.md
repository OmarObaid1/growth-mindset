# Markdown

## What is the MarkDown

### Markdown is a way to design text on the web. You control the width of the document; Formatting words in bold or italics, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in

# GitHub

## what is a GitHub Flavored Markdown

### GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown architecture that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easy to work with content on GitHub.com.

Note that some GitHub Flavored Markdown features are only available in problem descriptions, comments, and pull requests
