## what is the java Script
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.

The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. And in cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features.

Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantic

# Tutorials
Learn how to program in JavaScript with guides and tutorials.

For complete beginners
Head over to our Learning Area JavaScript topic if you want to learn JavaScript but have no previous experience with JavaScript or programming. The complete modules available there are as follows:

### JavaScript first steps
Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.
### JavaScript building blocks
Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.
### Introducing JavaScript objects
The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you.

# input or output in java Script
In the first article we saw how to change the DOM to display something, and then we saw how to handle user events. This time we are going to see how to get input from the user and combine that with the other two, to create a simple page that can great you.


One of the cornerstones of modern web application is the behind-the-scenes, asynchronous data communication between the server and the JavaScript code running in the browsers. While in Ajax, the X stands for XML, in reality many applications send data formatted as JSON. In most cases it is more convenient than sending XML.

In order to make this example simple, I've created a JSON file on the server and we will ask the server for that file. In more real world situation, the server would generate this JSON file on-demand based on information in its database, but currently we are only interested in the part that is in the browser

# use strict
The first one, on the other hand is slightly more involved. Just as in Perl, JavaScript also allows a lot of bad practices, and just as with Perl, the developers of JavaScript cannot just eliminate the features that allow these bad practices. Such move would break tons of code that worked earlier.

So in ECMAScript 5 a new feature was added. You can include a string "use strict"; at the beginning of a file or the beginning of a function and that will turn on the strict mode for the whole file or for that specific function, respectively. Because the construct is a string literal and because JavaScript has the strange behavior of disregarding string literals floating around the code, this snippet will be disregarded in any browser that does not support it. Which is not that interesting any more as by today virtually every browser on the market supports it.
